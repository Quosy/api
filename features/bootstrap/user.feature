  Scenario: Adding a new user
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/api/users" with body:
    """
    {
      "username": "jenaye",
      "password": "security",
      "isActive": true,
